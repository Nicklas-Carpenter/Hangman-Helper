## Installation

Installing the project is fairly simple. You can either clone the repository or download the ZIP file to obtain the project. The program is currently implemented in a Python executable. It requires the user to have installed Python on their computer; the Python interpreter installed must be able to run Python 3. Python can be downloaded [here](https://www.python.org/).

## Usage

To run the program, click on the executable or run it from the terminal.

## Contributing

Currently, the project is not in a state where there is much room for contribution. Once the base functionality has been properly implemented and tested, long term plans include creating a UI component. At this stage, contribution guidelines will be established and contributions will be greatly appreciated. If you would like to contribute ahead of this, feel free to open a pull request.

__If you encounter any bugs or issues, let me know by opening an issue in the [issue tab](https://github.com/Theseus001/Hangman-Helper/issues) on the Github page.__

## Credit

The word list this program uses was obtained from [dwl/english-words](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words). Thanks goes to dwyl for compiling nearly 480 000 words into an easy-to-parse text document and for creating a second, more Hangman friendly subset of the list.

Special thanks to Dr. Claude Anderson and the Rose-Hulman Computer Science and Software Engineering Department for teaching me to write clean and effecient code and encouraging me to do so.

Additionally, I would like to thank the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org) and their team for their extensive [documentation for Python 3](https://docs.python.org/3/).
