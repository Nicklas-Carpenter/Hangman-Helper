# Hangman-Helper
A solver for Hangman puzzles

## Installation
Installing the project is fairly simple. You can either clone the repository or download the ZIP file to obtain the project folder. No further installation steps are necessary. The program is currently implemented in a Python executable. This program requires the user to have installed Python on their computer; the Python interpreter installed must be able to run Python 3. Python can be downloaded an installed for most any system [here](https://www.python.org/).

## Usage
As long as the Python interpreter has been installed, all you need to do to run the program is click on the executable or run it from your favorite terminal. 

## Contributing
Currently, the project is not in a state where there is much room for contribution. Once the base functionality has been properly implemented and tested, long term plans include creating a UI component. At this stage, contribution guidelines will be established and contributions will be greatly appreciated.

__If you encounter and bugs or issues, let me know by openning an issue in the [issue tab](https://github.com/Theseus001/Hangman-Helper/issues) on the Github page.
## Credit
The word list this program uses can be found at this repository. Thanks goes to dwl for compiling nearly 480 000 words into an easy-to-parse text document and for creating a second, more Hangman friendly subset of the list.

Special thanks to the Dr. Claude Anderson and the Rose-Hulman Computer Science and Software Engineering Department for teaching me to write clean and effecient code and encouraging me to do so.

Additionally, I would like to thank the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org) and their team for writing clear, extensive, and easy-to-read [documentation for Python 3](https://docs.python.org/3/).
